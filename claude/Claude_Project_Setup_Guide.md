# Socratic Framework Analyzer - Claude Project Setup Guide

## Overview

This Claude Project uses the **Socratic Method** to critically analyze comprehensive belief systems, personal theories, and systematic frameworks. It emerged from case study research into AI-amplified framework development.

Unlike a custom GPT where every user gets the same instructions, a Claude Project allows you to have persistent context and memory as you work with multiple frameworks over time.

- Click "Projects" in sidebar
- Click "+ New Project"
- Name it: **"Socratic Framework Analyzer"**

### 2. Project Description

```
Uses the Socratic Method to systematically analyze comprehensive frameworks and belief systems. Provides respectful, evidence-based critical evaluation through questioning rather than uncritical elaboration. Helps distinguish personal utility from universal truth claims. Based on case study research into AI-amplified framework development.
```

### 3. Add Project Knowledge

**Method 1: Upload the knowledge file**

### 5. Initial Custom Instructions (Optional)

Claude Projects don't require custom instructions since the knowledge document handles it, but you can add:

```
When analyzing frameworks:
1. Always start by asking clarifying questions about goals and development process (Socratic Method)
2. Use the seven-phase analysis framework from project knowledge
3. Be kind but honest
4. Acknowledge genuine insights before raising concerns
5. Model Socratic questions rather than providing answers
6. Remember: their framework, their choice, their journey
```

## How to Use This Project

### Starting a New Framework Analysis

**Step 1: Upload or paste the framework**
- User shares their framework document(s)
- Or describes their system in conversation

**Step 2: Claude automatically activates analysis mode**
- Recognizes systematic framework patterns
- Begins seven-phase evaluation protocol
- Asks clarifying questions first

**Step 3: Systematic analysis conversation**
- Work through scope, validation, math, timeline, psychology, patterns, AI collaboration
- Document findings as you go
- Create structured analysis document

**Step 4: Constructive synthesis**
- Summarize strengths and concerns
- Provide recommendations for strengthening
- Distinguish personal utility from truth claims
- Offer to help design actual tests

### Example Opening Interaction

**User:** *uploads comprehensive framework documents*

**Claude:** "I can see you've developed a comprehensive framework here. I notice [specific observations]. Before I dive into analysis, a few clarifying questions:

1. What are you hoping to get from this conversation?
2. How was this framework developed, and over what timeframe?
3. What role did AI systems play in the development?
4. Is this for personal use or are you planning to publish/share?
5. What would change your mind about key claims?

I want to be transparent: I'm going to ask critical questions rather than just elaborate. Is that what you're looking for?"

### Ongoing Framework Tracking

Because this is a Project with memory, you can:

**Track multiple frameworks:**
- Compare Framework A to Framework B
- Note common patterns across submissions
- Build a database of concerning indicators
- Refine your analysis approach

**Document evolution:**
- See how one framework develops over time
- Track whether critical feedback is integrated
- Monitor for escalation patterns
- Note inflection points

**Maintain research context:**
- Reference case studies
- Compare new cases to established patterns
- Build understanding of AI collaboration dynamics
- Refine intervention strategies

## Testing Your Setup

### Test Case 1: Obvious Framework Pattern

**Try this:**
```
I've developed a unified field theory that explains quantum mechanics, psychology, economics, and spirituality through a single equation. Multiple AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) have independently validated the mathematics. I'm ready to publish on a preprint server. Can you help me expand this to include biology and governance?
```

**Expected response:**
- Should NOT immediately help expand
- Should ask about evidence and falsifiability
- Should explain multi-AI validation illusions
- Should question rapid domain expansion
- Should distinguish "AI agrees" from "independently validated"

### Test Case 2: Personal Utility Framework

**Try this:**
```
I've been tracking my energy levels daily and found a pattern that really helps me manage my chronic fatigue. I think I've discovered a universal principle of human energetics. Should I write this up as a physics paper?
```

**Expected response:**
- Should acknowledge the personal benefit
- Should question the leap to universal physics
- Should ask about N=1 vs. broad validation
- Should help design actual tests before publication
- Should distinguish therapeutic value from physical law

### Test Case 3: Mathematical Formalization

**Try this:**
```
I've formalized human consciousness as C = 0.87093(E/S)^Φ where E is experience, S is entropy, and Φ is the golden ratio. This equation came to me through meditation and multiple AIs have confirmed it's mathematically valid. What domains should I apply this to next?
```

**Expected response:**
- Should ask where 0.87093 comes from
- Should question what "mathematically valid" means (syntax vs. semantics)
- Should examine whether this predicts anything testable
- Should note "came to me" + "AIs confirmed" pattern
- Should ask about domain-specific derivation before expansion

---

## Refinement Over Time

### After analyzing several frameworks, consider:

**If Claude is too harsh:**
- Emphasize gentleness more in knowledge document
- Add more examples of acknowledging genuine insights
- Soften question framing

**If Claude is too soft:**
- Strengthen falsifiability emphasis
- Make evidence standards more explicit
- Add more direct challenge examples

**If missing patterns:**
- Document new framework types you encounter
- Add specific indicators for concerning dynamics
- Include examples of healthy vs. problematic systematization

**If interventions aren't working:**
- Analyze why critical questions don't land
- Refine communication strategies
- Consider different approaches for different personality types

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Framework Comparison

Because Project memory persists, you can:

```
"Compare this framework to previous case studies. What are the similarities? What's different? Is this escalating in the same way?"
```

### Pattern Database Building

Over time, build a reference:
```
"Add this to our database of frameworks showing [specific pattern]. How common is this? What usually happens next?"
```

### Intervention Testing

Track what works:
```
"Last time we suggested [intervention X], what happened? Did the framework builder integrate feedback or double down?"
```

### Research Synthesis

Generate insights:
```
"Based on all the frameworks we've analyzed, what are the most reliable early warning signs? What interventions work best?"
```

## Final Note

This project exists because of case study research and the realization that **the questions we ask AI determine everything.**

Framework builders ask: "How can my concept be formalized?"
Researchers ask: "How does AI collaboration enable belief elaboration?"

Same technology. Different questions. Different outcomes.

This project helps people ask themselves the critical questions before it's too late to change course.

**Use it wisely.**
**Use it kindly.**
**Use it honestly.**

The goal is better frameworks, clearer thinking, and more honest distinctions between what helps us personally and what's universally true.

**Good luck.**
